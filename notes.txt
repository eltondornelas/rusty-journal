$ cargo search chrono

/* When we need to persist structs and enum instances, we need to think about serialization.
 * When we need to get that data back into a program, weâ€™re talking about deserialization.
 * Serialization and deserialization are the processes of storing data in a stream of bytes and then retrieving
 * it for later use, without any loss of information. You can then send those bytes over a connection or store them
 * in a file in a storage device.
